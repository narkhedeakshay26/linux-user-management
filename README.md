Automated Linux User and Group Management Script ðŸš€

This repository contains a Bash script that automates the creation of users, groups, and file permissions on Linux systems. It's a time-saving solution for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and AI teams who need efficient user and access management.

Key Features
Interactive Input: Enter a username, group name, and password dynamically.
User Management: Automatically creates users and assigns them to specified groups.
Group Management: Checks if a group exists; creates one if it doesn't.
File Security: Creates a secure file with restricted permissions (440) to protect sensitive data.
Reusable: Run the script multiple times to manage new users, groups, and files effortlessly.
How to Use the Script

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

Make the Script Executable

Run this command to grant execution permissions:
chmod +x user_group_setup.sh

Run the Script
Execute the script with root privileges:
sudo ./user_group_setup.sh
Provide Input:
The script will ask for:

Username: e.g., employee-1
Group Name: e.g., dev
Password: Secure password for the user
File Name: Name of the file to create (e.g., securefile.txt)

Example Workflow
Input:
Enter the username to create: employee-1  
Enter the group name to add the user to: dev  
Enter the password for the user: ********  
Enter the name of the file to create (e.g., securefile.txt): securefile.txt  

Output:
Group 'dev' does not exist. Creating it...  
Creating user 'employee-1'...  
User 'employee-1' created successfully.  
User 'employee-1' added to group 'dev'.  
Creating file 'securefile.txt' in employee-1's home directory...  
File '/home/employee-1/securefile.txt' created with restricted permissions (440).

### Final Setup ###
User: employee-1  
Group: dev  
File: /home/employee-1/securefile.txt  
-r--r----- 1 root root 0 Dec 15 14:00 /home/employee-1/securefile.txt

Why Use This Script?
Saves Time: Automates repetitive user and group management tasks.
Error-Free: Handles validations like group existence and secure permissions.
Secure: Ensures sensitive files are accessible only to authorized users.
Scalable: Reusable for managing multiple users, ideal for shared systems.
Use Cases
System Administration: Onboarding new users and managing group permissions.
DevOps: Configuring Linux environments for teams.
AI Teams: Securing datasets or model files in isolated user environments.
